- Need to create structure for letters that are right and wrong
- use the letters in the right place and wrong letters to find and suggest a word
- meaning, based on previous guesses, it should find words that does not contain words in the wrong container

with the guesses, if green/yellow, obtain the word list for the letter from masterlist and insert into a list.
then take that list and insert into the intersection function to find words that are shared between each of the lists
    !!! SOMETHING TO MIND: forgot
    oh. for the yellows, insert the lists that yellow characters could be in but not the position that was used in the guess.
    so if yellow was in pos 5 and green alr has 124, or 12, give list of 3 and 23, respectively, to the insersection list.

then on the intersection list, give first word based on word.txt order, have the container self sort and give first, give the one
    with the most common letters, give the one with the most vowels, or give based on random (could be given by user or self used on algo)
    //probably should also remove the guessed word from vector if it is not correct. MAYBE. but most likely.
