HOW THIS SOLVER WORKS (PLANS TO BE):

takes all greens and any word with a letter in that position will be added into a list as a vector.
this will be done with any other greens
    ++ NEED TO DO THE SAME FOR YELLOWS so that it becomes more accurate.

once the list is created, find all common words and pick word from that and continue again.
the suggested word is not random and comes from the first of the list.

what needs to be done:
- consider the yellows, though they may not be in the correct positions, it could be used to find words with the same 
    letter but in different positions with other matchings, if there are any, into the intersctions list

- also need to consider the greyed / invalid letters so that the search does not consider repeated letters that provide no use
    to finding the right word.

- what if the first word provides all greys ?

++ for later updates:
container for new letters found ?
container to consider the frequency of each letter for every word in the word list.
    this can be probably be used for something like finding the most common letter and using that to consider the next word suggestion
    there are other things to do with frequency, as well
